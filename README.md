# Student-Grade-Calculator
This project is a Student Grade Calculator developed using HTML, CSS, and PHP that allows students to enter marks for five different subjects through a simple and well-structured user interface. Each subject has its own input field, making it easy for users to enter their marks accurately.

When the user submits the form, PHP processes the entered marks using the POST method and performs the necessary calculations. The application calculates the total marks, determines the percentage, and assigns a grade based on predefined grading criteria. All calculated results, including total marks, percentage, and grade, are displayed clearly on the same page after submission.

This project helps beginners understand how to work with form handling, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements in PHP, while also practicing frontend design using CSS. It serves as a practical example of how backend logic and frontend design work together to create dynamic web applications.
